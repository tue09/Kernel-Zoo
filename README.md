# Kernel Zoo

Welcome to the Kernel Zoo, a comprehensive suite designed to apply various convolution kernels and normalization methods to images. This toolkit allows you to experiment with different image processing techniques to enhance, filter, or detect features within an image.

## Features

- **Multiple Kernels**: Includes a variety of convolution kernels such as identity, sharpen, negative, outline, box blur, gaussian blur, emboss, sobel operators, and laplacian.
- **Normalization Methods**: Supports various normalization methods like min-max, sigmoid, clipping, mean, standard deviation, L1 norm, and L2 norm.
- **Customizable Convolution**: Adjust padding and stride settings to control the convolution process.
- **Visualization**: Easily compare the original and convoluted images side by side.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tue09/Kernel-Zoo.git
